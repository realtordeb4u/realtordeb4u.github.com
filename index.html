					<div id="bio">

						<p> I received my license in 2006 however I've been involved in Real Estate for over twenty years.  I specialize in residential and land, but I'm always open to all area's of Real Estate.  I put my heart and sole into every opportunity I get to work with clients, to achieve selling and or buying of properties. </p>
						<p>I was born and raised in Healdsburg Ca. Relocated to Lakeport Ca. in 2003.  I have spent alot of time in Lake County prior to moving here.  I know the county has a bright future and am proud to be a resident of this beautiful country side. I have also recently joined MMS in Sonoma County.
						My motto is to go the full mile, exhuast all avenues and work endlessly to give my clients what they come to me in the first place for.  I appreciate everyday to get the chance to work with new and returning clients.  I'm always there for you. </p>
